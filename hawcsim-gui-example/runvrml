# This is an example macro which works well with the single tank setup in
# the hawcsim-config directory.
# Can be run in the HAWCSim terminal with command like:
# /control/execute runvrml

# Create a .wrl file suitable for viewing in a VRML viewer
/vis/open VRML2FILE

# Define visualisation properties
/control/execute initvis.mac

# For file-based drivers, use this to create an empty detector view:
/vis/viewer/flush

# Shoot a particle from the list
/run/beamOn 1
